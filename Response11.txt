temperature control
Temperature control  Monroe 111 is a nightmare from a climate perspective It
alternates between too cold and most often way too hot
Instructor chairdesk temperature control dim able lights plugs for students also there
is a fan that is constantly on and prevents communication
Reconfigurable tables
temperature control reconfigurable seating good white board dimmable lights
Lecture capture ability with both video and audio
Movable chairs and tables built in clickers
Screen covers most of white board
Chalkboard whiteboards are terrible Also the available undersized wihiteboard is
covered by the projector screen making it useless
Temperature control
Multiple whiteboards tiered seating ability to project students work markers are always
missing wireless mictrophone temperature control split screen software wall with
whiteboard paint
Depends which room I am assigned I teach Honors seminars with 15 or less students
and rarely get good seminar rooms
My current classroom and this semester I am teaching a smaller class not the Art Now
which is a large lecture class has a small screen mounted on the wall leftover from
the Corcoran We could use a large white board mounted and a smarter screen which
is larger than the current one and has better color resolution We could use a dimming
light switch Some of the chairs are broken
Easily movable chairs screen covers most of whiteboard very little extra space to move
anything around  I drag two tables from the front of the room into the hall to create more
space
Chalk and blackboard Screen should not cover whiteboardblackboard Dimmable
lighting Temperature control Walls have whiteboard paint
1 ability to project student work limited availability 2 temperature control 3 problem
with structural pillar in middle of classroom
board space
Movable desks and chairs markers clicker
Every semester I have a classroom without a projector Instead I have a TV and VCR I
think all would agree that this is truly absurd
Screen covers whiteboard split screen computer software clickersdongle
current camera dimmerboard for the lighting in the dance studio so essential for at least
60 to 70 of the creative dance classes presentations during class time and on
weekends for developed productions
Screen should not cover whiteboardblackboard
Computer projector and screen or a computer and TV would be fine too
I would love cameras that would allow me to bring guest speakers from around the
world via Skype The guests can see us we can see the guests
Screen
Screen that does not cover blackboard intructors computer ability to project students
work walls that have whiteboard walls etc
Configurable seating Enough seats for every other seat during exams I need 140 seats
for an 80 student class to sit apart during exams or a centralized large exam room
Screen should not cover whiteboardblackboard
There are often more students than chairs and Ive had to fetch some from other
classrooms Chairs are often broken Classroom can be reconfigured some before class
with difficulty but then not reconfigured without taking lots of time: tables are
theoretically moveable but require 2 people Room isnt big enough for 25 students plus
me and a grad TA to move around in so Ive had to use the hallway for break out
groupings
Controllable heating and cooling
Whiteboards not blocked by screen Also it is hard every semester just to get a laptop
projector connection I regularly have to move when my class is scheduled to get such a
classroom
Screen covers white board the quality of the projector is awful the plugs dont always
work it would be nice to have clickers for students your list also included things that I
dont rate high at all We need large markers for the whiteboards so that students who
are in the upper seats can read the material on the whiteboard There is way too much
furniture constantly on stage I feel like I am doing an obstacle course It would be nice
to have seats that turned so that students could do group activities in the large lecture
In the room I used last semester the projector wasnt working and there were no other
classrooms into which to move my class Multiple classrooms have
blackboardswhiteboards that are not visible when the screen is down
Instructors projector
instructors computer
Space for the instructor to move around  in Funger 222 for example wtih 70 students
they are packed in like sardines Similarly it is difficult to arrange chairs into small groups
for group work discussions etc There is also a lack of temperature control The
projection screen covers the middle swatch of the whiteboard which makes it challenging
for students to see both
All of the above Except wifi and movable tablesseats corkboard for students work
There is no computer in one of my classrooms even though I requested it well in
advance
Computer podiums often block a significant portion of the board this is a campuswide
problem  bad classroom design Some classes Duques are so wide that students
cant see the whole board Rooms rarely have markers or chalk The only thing that
should be in a classroom are good boards GW had better classrooms 20 years ago
Corkboard to pin posters doesnt even begin to describe the need for permanent critique
wall space that allows repeated pinning of printed work on a neutralcolor background
preferably black or white This is needed throughout the semester in all my courses
Currently we use moveable black foamboard panels that are showing their age and dont
fit underneath the AC installation

I have to bring my own laptop to BELL 108 every Monday night
Document camera
You cant use multiple projection screens moreover the screens cover half the
whiteboards The lectern with the main computer is also stupidly located in the center of
the classroom instead of off to the side

I wish there could be a computer room in the SPH building
Additional washout sink for screens in screenprint class
Clickers
Working markers not dried out Chalk Erasers  These do not seem to be large or
complicated requests  needs but as classrooms become more hightech the less
available are these items Faculty sometimes walk from classroom to classroom looking
for such items
lecturn is too tall  obscures view of class
Cannot move chairsmakes it difficult for student groups and teams to meet No
computer or projectormust check out equipment from across campus Tables very
difficult to maneuver around and too big for the space tables have places for plugs but
there are not outlets for the tables The timebands are also incredibly restricting

I am teaching 70 Students in Funger 220 The classroom is hoplessly crowded
Students coming in late cant find seats Funger 220 can only hold 50 students max
comfortably If we are to teach in larger classrooms we need classrooms that can
accommodate larger classes GWU is failing to provide the minimum in adequate
classroom space while you send out silly surveys about movable tables built in clickers
etc That is like worring about desert when there is no main course This survey is a
reflection on the competence of the office of the provost If you dont know that we have
classrooms that are hoplessly overcrowded just walk around campus sometime
Markers and whiteboard there is a chalk board with chalk but it is very messy Software
that remembers instructor’s configurationsbookmarks Corkboard to pin posters Walls
have whiteboard paint Movable tables on wheels Reconfigurablemodular tables
Movable seats on wheels Temperature control that works Also: Screen at side is
difficult for students to see: it is on the opposite side of the room and there is a light
directly above it that is only adjustable by turning off all lights in the room which is not
always a good idea
storage multiple outlets for students clicker dongle round tables are a few
A clock GW is the only university Ive ever seen that doesnt have clocks at the back of
all classrooms so instructors can keep easily keep track of the time without constantly
checking a watch or a phone while also trying to lecture Temperature control is my
classrooms is uniformly poor as well
Wireless mic screen covers whiteboard dimmable lighting
Ability to project two different media sources on two separate screens Ability to record
both screens in lecture capture

It often happens that the classrooms I am initially assigned lack my most important
requirements laptop internet doc cam etc I have to request a new classroom As a
result this semester I am teaching small classes in large lecture halls Missing from your
lists is BUILDING preference: I want all my classes to meet in 1957 E St The rooms in
1776 G St are horrible
Reconfigurable tables or at least movable tables

Computer with clicker dongle Builtin clickers into seats desks
temperature control sometimes sufficient whiteboard markers and erasers split screens
for projection that is so that I can see one screen and students see another
Ability to turn off lighting immediately above projection screen while keeping full lighting
in the rest of the room
Eraser I have given up on having markers
Almost all Seating is not changable technology in many of the classrooms is not
working or out of date Thermastats do not work
not enough chalk and markers
Builtin clickers multiple projection screens space to interact with students
multiple projection screens  differently facing screen should not cover blackboard
temperature control built in clickers round tables  movable tables
No projector no computer speakers more spotlights more storage space for paintings
electrical outlets better lighting in general need windows as it is a drawing and painting
studio more storage for hazardous liquids closets
Reconfigurable seating room is too small to move chairs Movable seats on wheels
most of the features named are missing from my currently assigned classroom
projector screen table seating outlets for student laptops ways to share student work
easily etc
Most important is not for equipment but for support in the class Specifically need for
more TAs and readers to support labs discussion sections and grade homeworks
The projector screens all cover the white boards  it would be nice to have additional
white boards apart from where projectors are Also the lectern is oddly placed  to move
around in the classroom the professor will run into the screen when it is down in other
words the lectern is too close to the boards and screen
movable chairs and desks
Ability to project students laptop screens Builtin clickers into seats desks Split screen
software on computers in room there are no computers in the room setting up even 20
laptops every time is a pain Dimmable lighting
Lectern too small to hold computer and other materials
The screen is covering most of the whiteboard so I have to turn off the computer screen
in order to use the board
